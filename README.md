# Bug Fix Lab

## Learning Goals

- Identify problematic anti-patterns in code

## Introduction

An anti-pattern is a bad solution to a problem. In programming, anti-patterns
are common mistakes programmers make that might seem to solve a problem
initially but often introduce new, additional problems. These mistakes appear
often enough in programming that we can learn how to identify them, which then
empowers us to eliminate them from our own code and incorporate better
solutions.

### Identify Potentially Problematic Anti-Patterns in Code

We're going to take a look at a broken bit of code and determine where it's
going wrong.

(Note for writer: Probably multi-call with some antipatternish abuse of each and
(accumulation.)

## Conclusion

By learning about common anti-patterns, we can learn to spot them in our own
code and remove them in favor of stronger, more reliable programming solutions.
